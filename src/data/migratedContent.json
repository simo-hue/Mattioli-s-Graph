    "content": "\n# Friendship and Love\n\nHuman relationships are the fundamental pillar of our existence, it is no coincidence that it is said that man is a social animal... Friendships, family ties and romantic relationships contribute to defining not only the quality of our life, but also who we are and what we can become. We cannot ignore the enormous impact that these connections have on us, for better or for worse, and on our lives.\n\n## Don't settle: Aim for the 1%\n\nWe live in a world where too many people settle. The fear of loneliness pushes many to build relationships that do not enrich, but limit. This attitude is unacceptable in my opinion. The quality of the people you choose to have in your life can make the difference between a full life and a mediocre one.\n\nAs Jim Rohn said:\n> “You are the average of the five people you hang out with the most.”\n\nSurrounding yourself with the right people doesn't mean finding just anyone, but looking for that tiny 1% that inspires you, pushes you to grow, supports you in challenges and motivates you to become the best version of yourself.\n\n## Friendship: The value of sincere support\n\nA true friend is not just a companion for laughter, but also a partner in personal growth and the support you know you can count on in the darkest and most difficult moments. The best friends are those who are not afraid to confront you with your mistakes, to encourage you when necessary and to celebrate your successes with you. Choosing friends who share your values ​​and aspirations is not always easy, but it is *essential*.\n\nAs Seneca said:\n> “A friend is someone who wants for you what he wants for himself.”\n\nBe careful who you trust. Not everyone who seems like a friend is really one, and not everyone has the courage or the ability to support you in times of need.\n\n## Love Relationships: Building, Not Limiting\n\nChoosing a partner is perhaps one of the most important decisions in our lives. The person you choose to share your time and emotions with has the power to determine your destiny. A healthy and authentic relationship is one that enriches you, pushes you to new heights, and creates a safe space for your personal development.\n\nAs Friedrich Nietzsche wrote:\n> “It is not the lack of love, but the lack of friendship that makes marriages unhappy.”\n\nDon’t settle for someone just because you’re afraid of being alone. Have the courage to wait for that person who not only completes your life, but elevates it.\n\n## Conclusion: Choose Wisely\n\nLife is too short to waste it on the wrong people. Every relationship you choose should be a conscious choice, not a fallback. Surround yourself with people who challenge you to be better, who support you in difficult times, and who share your vision of life.\n\nTake the time to think about who you want in your circle. It’s not easy, but it’s one of the most important decisions you can make. As Aristotle said:\n> “In poverty and other adversities of life, true friends are a safe refuge. The young who love and the old who are loved are the greatest comforts we can have.”\n\nRemember: It’s not just about company, it’s about quality. Choose the 1% in all areas of your life.\n\n![Remember To Dream Big](fa.webp)",

    "content": "Knowing how to be alone is an often underestimated skill, but it is incredibly important for our personal growth. In a world that seems to constantly push us to seek the company of others, taking time for ourselves can be a revolutionary act. Not only does it allow us to know ourselves better, but it can turn into a real training ground for growing as a person.\n\n## Know Yourself\n\nSolitude is a precious space to get in touch with ourselves. When we are alone, without distractions, we can listen to our thoughts and discover who we really are. What makes us happy? What do we want from life? What are our values? These are questions that we rarely find the time to address, but which can guide us towards a more authentic life.\n\n## Break Free from Social Pressure\n\nIt is not normal, nor necessary, to always be surrounded by people. We often feel obliged to be part of groups or situations that do not represent us, just for fear of being judged. Learning to be alone helps us break free from this social pressure. There is nothing wrong with taking time for yourself, saying no to things that don’t make you feel good, and reclaiming your independence.\n\n## Becoming Independent and Strong\n\nWhen we learn to be comfortable alone, we become stronger. We no longer need to constantly lean on others to find security or happiness. This doesn’t mean closing ourselves off from the world, but being independent, knowing that our inner strength is enough to face life’s challenges.\n\n## Harnessing the Value of Solitude\n\nSolitude is fertile ground for creativity and reflection. When we give ourselves time to be alone, thoughts and ideas often emerge that we would never have had otherwise. However, these moments must be lived consciously. If we let ourselves be overwhelmed by negative stimuli, such as excessive use of social media, we risk turning solitude into isolation and, in the worst cases, depression.\n\nTo make the most of solitude, we must live it with intention: reading a good book, meditating, walking in nature or simply reflecting on ourselves. These moments can be incredibly regenerating and transformative.\n\n## Solitude as a Gym for Growth\n\nSolitude is not an enemy, but an opportunity. It is a space that allows us to grow, to become more aware and to strengthen our independence. As Rainer Maria Rilke wrote:\n\n> **\"Solitude is like rain: it rises from the sea towards the evening, from distant and remote plains, it rises to the sky, which always possesses it.\"**\n\nTaking time for ourselves is a gift we can give ourselves, every day. Don't be afraid of being alone: ​​that's where you could discover the best version of yourself...but I would also like to remind you that\n\n> Not everyone is able to do it, but you must be one of them...",

    "title": "repetition is the mother of all skills",
    "content": "\nThere’s a timeless truth in the saying, *“Repetition is the mother of all skills.”* It’s something I’ve come to embrace fully since I integrated a method that has completely transformed the way I learn and internalize concepts: **the immersion method**.\n\n---\n\n## What is the Immersion Method?\n\nThe immersion method is exactly what it sounds like—a full, deep dive into the subject or skill you want to master. Instead of just skimming the surface or approaching learning sporadically, immersion means surrounding yourself with the material, over and over again, until it becomes second nature. It’s not just about repetition but also about consistency and engagement.\n\nHere’s how I applied it:\n\n1. **Daily Exposure**  \n   I made sure to interact with the concepts every single day. Whether it was listening to a podcast, reading a book, taking notes, or even talking about it with others, I created a constant feedback loop.\n\n2. **Active Repetition**  \n   Instead of passively consuming material, I actively revisited it. For example:\n   - I reread the same books multiple times. Each read revealed something I missed the first time or offered new insights as my understanding deepened.  \n   - I rewrote my notes. This process helped reinforce the key points in my mind.\n\n3. **Practical Application**  \n   Immersion wasn’t just theoretical. I put what I learned into practice in real-world scenarios, which solidified the knowledge in my subconscious.\n\n---\n\n## From Subconscious Absorption to Visible Results\n\nThe most incredible change I experienced was seeing how concepts that once felt elusive started to flow naturally. It’s as if they had seeped into my subconscious. I no longer had to think so hard to recall them; they were just *there*, ready for use.\n\nFor example, while studying personal development topics, I found that principles I’d been exposed to for weeks suddenly became part of my decision-making process. I didn’t have to remind myself to “stay present” or “focus on the process” anymore—it just happened. This transformation wasn’t magic; it was immersion at work.\n\n---\n\n## Why Repetition is Crucial\n\nRepetition isn’t boring; it’s foundational. Every time you revisit a concept:\n- You **strengthen the neural pathways** in your brain, making recall faster and easier.\n- You see new perspectives that weren’t apparent the first time. A single read-through of a book or course can’t uncover all its wisdom.\n\nHere’s what I’ve learned about the power of repetition:\n- **Books are meant to be reread.** Some of my favorite books have been revisited three or four times, and each time I gain new insights or reinforce old ones.  \n- **Learning never stops.** What seems redundant often turns out to be the foundation for mastery.\n\n---\n\n## The Impact of Immersion on Me\n\nThe immersion method has had a profound effect on my growth, both personally and professionally. Not only have I seen results in terms of knowledge retention, but also in how I think and act. Concepts that I struggled to grasp now feel second nature, and my confidence has skyrocketed because I trust in the process.\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts: Repetition as a Way of Life\n\nIn a world obsessed with novelty, we often undervalue repetition. But true mastery isn’t about skimming through countless books or ideas; it’s about deeply understanding and integrating a few. Immersion and repetition are how you turn knowledge into action and action into habits.\n\nSo, let me leave you with this:  \nRevisit that book you love. Redo that course you enjoyed. Practice that skill over and over. You might be surprised by how much growth lies in going *deeper*, not wider.\n\n---\n**What are your thoughts on repetition and immersion?

Chi soffre di questa sindrome sminuisce le proprie abilità, dubita della propria competenza e si sente colpevole dei propri traguardi, temendo il giudizio e il fallimento. \n\n\n### Ignorance\n1. Inconsapevolezza o incompetenza (più o meno colpevole).\n2. Condizione determinata dalla mancanza di istruzione o di educazione.\n\n---\n\nWith this said we can start...\n\nI'm really struggling to \"categorize\" myself and figure out whether I'm ignorant or extremely affected by impostor syndrome.\n\n## The Hard Truth Of Being Ambitius\n\nIf you know me or have read a few articles on my blog, you'll already know that I'm a very ambitious person, hence the need to become \"THE BEST VERSION OF MYSELF\" (even if that's an overused term these days).\n\nTo become that, I have to sacrifice a lot...if NOT everything, to acquire as many skills (useful and marketable) as possible in the shortest possible time.\n\nOften, however, like right now, with about 10 days to go until my graduation, I feel like I have no skills at all (even though I've actually been pursuing university with perseverance, commitment, and even satisfaction).\n\n## What About The Peers?\n\nSocial comparison destroys me, between social media like LinkedIn, where it seems everyone is working and getting accepted for internships (something I'm actively seeking, with no results so far after hundreds of applications) in big tech or dream companies.\n\nThen, when I interact with other people, very often, I feel and notice that I'm much \"ahead\" / smarter / on top of things than them, because, for example, I'm not only vertically focused on tech in IT but also in psychology or economics & content creation.\n\nAnd precisely because of this, the dilemma arises: \"But if I focused solely on one subject, how good could I become?\" I just don't want to give up and abandon other interests that attract me.\n\n\n## How Can You brake This Thought?\nIt's truly an incredible loop, but I think the only thing I can do right now is to continue studying/educating myself as much as possible so as NOT to have regrets (or at least minimize them) and to be able to create the best possible future (given my starting point).\n\n---\n\nPS: I think this last aside I added about one's origins is CRUCIAL because everyone plays THEIR OWN GAME and not that of others... and this is precisely where we, as human beings, make mistakes and allow ourselves to be influenced by social comparison.",

But today, the story is completely different. We live in an era where the barriers to learning have all but disappeared, thanks to the transformative power of technology.\n\n## The Gift of Unlimited Access\n\nThe internet, smartphones, and countless platforms like YouTube, Coursera, Udemy, and even Wikipedia have democratized information. Want to master photography? There's a free tutorial for that. Fascinated by astrophysics? Enroll in an online course taught by a renowned professor. Curious about coding? Interactive coding platforms and forums can turn you into a developer from the comfort of your home.\n\nThis unprecedented access means that anyone with a genuine passion and determination can become an expert in virtually any field. The tools are there, waiting to be used. Ignorance, in many ways, is no longer an excuse. It has become a choice.\n\n## The Challenge: Information Overload\n\nHowever, with great access comes great responsibility. The same internet that empowers us is also flooded with misinformation, half-truths, and outright falsehoods. Separating valuable, accurate knowledge from noise has become a skill in itself. Critical thinking and a skeptical eye are essential for navigating this sea of information.\n\nHere are a few tips to ensure you're learning from reliable sources:\n1. **Check the credentials** of the author or creator. Are they an expert in the field?\n2. **Cross-reference information** across multiple reputable sources.\n3. **Look for peer-reviewed or fact-checked content.**\n4. **Beware of biases**, especially in sensational or overly opinionated materials.\n\n## The Future of Self-Education\n\nAs technology continues to evolve, so will the tools for self-education. Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality are already shaping the way we learn, making it more interactive and immersive. But one thing remains constant: the drive to learn must come from within.\n\nBy embracing the resources at our fingertips and being mindful of the content we consume, we can unlock boundless potential.

    "content": "\n# The importance of humility, but without losing self-confidence\n\nHumility is one of the most appreciated and sought-after qualities, both in personal and professional life. Being humble helps us grow, learn from others and recognize that we do not always have all the answers. It allows us to approach people with respect, creating authentic relationships based on mutual esteem. But it is important to remember that, like all virtues, humility must also be cultivated with balance.\n![](napkin-selection-4.png)\n\n## When humility becomes a limit\n\nHowever, there is an insidious risk that hides behind excessive humility. While on the one hand it can be a sign of maturity and wisdom, on the other it can turn into a trap that undermines self-confidence. Being excessively humble can lead to underestimating one's abilities, to belittling one's successes or even to avoiding opportunities for fear of not being \"enough\" to face them.\n\nIn a world where comparing ourselves to others is the order of the day, it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that humility means self-deprecation or extreme modesty. But being humble does not mean belittling yourself, but rather recognizing your limits without losing sight of your strengths. Humility must coexist with a healthy dose of self-esteem.\n![](napkin-selection-2.png)\n\n## Cultivating a balance: Humility and Self-Confidence\n\nThe ideal balance consists of recognizing your own value without falling into arrogance. We can be aware of our skills, celebrating successes with gratitude but without turning them into vanity. We must learn to recognize what we have achieved without feeling superior to others, but also without belittling our path.\n\nTo achieve this balance, it is useful to ask yourself: \"Am I rejecting this recognition because I am truly humble, or because I do not believe in myself enough?\" Cultivating self-confidence does not mean becoming arrogant, but having the awareness of your own abilities to confidently face challenges and goals.\n![](napkin-selection-3.png)\n\n## In Conclusion\n\nHumility and self-confidence are not conflicting qualities, but two sides of the same coin. Being humble keeps us grounded in reality, but having self-confidence pushes us to dream bigger and face challenges without fear.\n\n> “Humility does not consist in thinking less of yourself, but in thinking less of yourself.” – *C.S. Lewis*\n\n![](napkin-selectiona.png)",

    "content": "Kindness is one of those little gestures that make days brighter, both for the giver and the receiver. I have always found comfort in being kind to others, even in the simplest actions. A smile, a greeting, a “how are you?” may seem insignificant, but they often have a profound impact. They are small acts that cost nothing, but that bring enormous wealth.\n\nI like to think that every little kindness is a seed of happiness that spreads around us. From holding a door open for those who follow, to giving a coin to someone in need, to giving a smile to someone in need. These gestures not only make others feel better, but they also fill my heart with joy. And more often than not, I realize that, without even wanting to, I have given a smile to someone else.\n\nI remember with particular affection an episode that happened during a visit to a museum in Palermo. As I was leaving, I greeted the ticket inspector who was near the door. He seemed surprised and thanked me with sincere gratitude. He said, *\"You were the only one who greeted me among those who came out.\"* Those words struck a chord with me. It was such a simple gesture, almost automatic for me, but for him it made a difference. It reminded me of how powerful a small kindness can be.\n\nUltimately, I believe the world needs more love and kindness. We shouldn't expect grand gestures to make a difference; often it's the simplest actions that leave a mark. As Mother Teresa said:\n\n> **\"Not all of us can do great things, but we can do small things with great love.\"**\n\nSo why not start today? Spread love wherever you go.",

    "content": "\nWe often live in a rush, projected towards new goals and expectations. In this vortex, we can take for granted what we have: our health, our family, the people who love us, or even the simple warmth of the sun on our skin. Yet, when we learn to stop and really “see” these things, we discover a source of serenity and strength that can change our way of living.\n\n## **The Beauty of Everyday Life**\n\nBeing grateful does not only mean recognizing great achievements or resounding successes, but also stopping to observe what surrounds us. It may seem trivial, but appreciating a morning coffee, a sincere smile, or the hug of a dear friend has immense value. These moments remind us that happiness does not lie in great events, but in the sum of many small moments lived with awareness.\n\n> “The simplest things, often the quietest, are those that resonate most within us.”\n\n## **Gratitude for Health and Relationships**\n\nHealth is one of the most precious gifts we possess and that we usually tend to notice only when it is lacking. Practicing gratitude for our body and its ability to allow us to live and experience is a first step towards a deeper appreciation of ourselves and life. Relationships, whether they are family or friends, give us the opportunity to feel understood, supported and loved. And this too is never a given.\n\n## **The Power of Nature: Sunsets, the Sun and the Cycle of the Seasons**\n\nThe natural world is full of beauty and wonder, and just taking a few minutes to observe it can instantly make you feel more serene and grounded. Watching a sunset, feeling the wind on your skin, or perceiving the warmth of the sun helps us reconnect to the present and appreciate the simplicity of life. These moments do not require money or status; they are there, every day, for anyone who wants to stop and experience them.\n\n## **The Journey of Gratitude: A Growth Path**\n\nI came to these thoughts thanks to some personal growth courses that I took. In particular, one of the courses that had a significant impact on me was *Optimism and Resilience* by Nicoletta Stella, which I attended during my time at the Collegio di Merito Don Mazza in Verona. This course helped me develop a more open and resilient mindset, making me understand how important it is to appreciate every aspect of life, even in difficult moments.\n\n## **Gratitude Practices in Daily Life**\n\nFor anyone who wants to start practicing gratitude, here are some practical tips:\n\n- **Write a gratitude journal**: Every day, write down three things you are grateful for. They can be simple, like the food you ate or a pleasant conversation.\n- **Stop and reflect**: Every time you feel a positive emotion, try to stop and live it fully, without thinking about what comes after.\n- **Expressing Gratitude to Others**: Saying “thank you” to someone or letting them know how much they mean to you can improve not only your mood, but also the bond between you.\n\nLife as a Gift\n\nIn conclusion living appreciating what you have doesn’t mean not trying to improve yourself or reach new goals. It means remembering that every moment has a value and that we are part of a unique and unrepeatable experience. Being grateful for everyday things – from the bonds with those we love to the simple pleasures of nature – helps us cultivate a fuller and more satisfying life.\n\n---\n\n> Appreciating life means finding beauty even in simple moments, welcoming every moment as a gift, and recognizing that true happiness comes from gratitude for what we already have.\n\n\n\n[Watch Video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-3IHnZm4G8)\n\n",

    "content": "# My Journey from Hater to Curious\n\nI admit that history was my nemesis during my school years. When the professor entered the classroom and started talking about dates, battles and rulers, I felt lost. It all seemed so boring and distant from my reality. I couldn't perceive the value of that knowledge: why on earth would I be interested in what had happened centuries ago?\n\nOver the years, however, something changed. I began to realize my gaps, feeling ashamed of how little I knew about our past (not with others but with myself). I understood that ignoring history was not only an academic shortcoming, but a real limitation in understanding the world around me.\n\n## Discovering the Value of History\n\nWhat once seemed useless to me, today appears as a precious resource. Why? Because history is cyclical. Events of the past, in different forms, are still repeated today. If we look carefully, we can find surprising analogies between what happened in the past centuries and what is happening in the world today. Economic crises, social tensions, international conflicts: it seems that humanity is condemned to continually relive the same mistakes (and this makes me think a lot).\n\nUnderstanding history has given me an additional tool to interpret the present. The more I study past events, the more I realize that it is not just a matter of memorizing dates and names, but of recognizing patterns, dynamics and cycles that recur.\n\n## Learning from the mistakes of others\n\nOne of the most valuable lessons I have learned is that history is not just a book of past facts, but a practical guide for the present and above all for the future. Observing how leaders of the past have moved, what decisions they have made (and what mistakes they have made), allows me to draw lessons that I can also apply in my life. I am not just talking about political or economic decisions, but also about how to deal with difficult or unexpected situations.\n\nIn a way, knowing history is like having a map of the territory: it helps you orient yourself, avoid obstacles and not repeat the same mistakes made by those who came before us. Learning from the mistakes of others is a way to save time and pain, taking advantage of the wisdom accumulated over the centuries.\n\n## My commitment to improving\n\nToday, I try to make up for lost time, also because nowadays ignorance is a choice given that you can watch documentaries for free, listen to podcasts that delve into historical events and many other contents are available to everyone. I can't change my school past, but I can certainly enrich my present.\n\nIt's not an easy process: there are still times when I feel overwhelmed by all the information I don't know. But I don't let myself get discouraged. Every day that passes, I discover something new that helps me better understand the world I live in.\n\n> “Those who don't know history are condemned to repeat it.” – *George Santayana*\n\nAnd with this quote, I want to remind myself (and whoever reads) that the past is not just a lesson for historians, but an opportunity for each of us to grow and improve.",

His story is an extraordinary example of how to transform difficulties into opportunities, and his way of life is a lesson that leads to reflection.\n\n## Gratitude for Opportunities\n\nBeing a student at the Collegio di Merito Don Mazza in Verona is an opportunity that has allowed me to participate in significant events like this. Meetings like this are precious opportunities to grow and look at the world with different eyes. I can only be grateful for everything that this college offers me, not only in terms of training, but also in terms of inspiration and awareness.\n\n## The Daniele Cassioli Foundation\n\nDaniele is not only an athlete, but also the founder of an extraordinary reality: the [Daniele Cassioli Foundation](https://www.danielecassioli.it). This organization is dedicated to supporting young people with disabilities, helping them discover and develop their potential through sports and educational activities. It is incredible to see how this foundation not only offers opportunities, but also contributes to changing society's mentality towards disability.\n\n## A Deeper Awareness\n\nMeeting Daniele made me reflect on how often, as able-bodied people, we take many things for granted. His story taught me that it is not what we lack that defines who we are, but what we develop to overcome challenges. Daniele has honed extraordinary skills, demonstrating that difficulties can become strengths.\n\n## Making Fun of One's Flaws\n\nOne of the aspects that struck me most about Daniele is his ability to make fun of his own flaws and misfortunes. This not only makes him incredibly charismatic, but it is also a life lesson: knowing how to laugh at ourselves allows us to live with more serenity and at peace with ourselves. His light-heartedness is contagious and shows that accepting one's limits is the first step to overcoming them.\n\n## His Books and the Value of Sport\n\nDaniele is also the author of inspirational books. Among these, I read one of his texts and it struck me for the depth of his messages and the simplicity with which he manages to convey complex concepts. Furthermore, during our meeting, he underlined the importance of sport not only for physical health, but also for mental well-being and happiness. Sport is a great life teacher and a way to create authentic bonds.\n\n## A Social Role of Great Impact\n\nDaniele's role in society is fundamental. He helps young people with disabilities to see a brighter future and not give up in the face of difficulties. In a world that tends to put labels, Daniele shows that you can live a full and fulfilling life, transmitting confidence and motivation.\n\n## The Importance of Community, Even in Individual Sports\n\nAn anecdote that struck me was the story of the trips to the competitions. Although water skiing is an individual sport, Daniele described how the trips were moments of fun and community. I particularly remember the episode of the 2 athletes in wheelchairs stuck in the room and Daniele who had to resolve the situation.\nHe showed me that even in individual sports there is room for sharing and friendship, making the experience even richer.\n\n---\n\nMeeting Daniele Cassioli was one of the most significant experiences I have ever lived, and I will carry his teachings with me. His story taught me to see life from a different perspective and to believe that difficulties are not a limit, but an opportunity to grow and live fully.\n\n---\n\nI leave the live of the event here\n\n\n\n[Watch Video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yx9_MLF5vE)\n\n",

    "content": "\n## Introduction to Napoleon Hill's Philosophy of Success\n*Think and Grow Rich* by Napoleon Hill is an evergreen in personal development and success. First published in 1937, it is a practical guide that teaches how positive thinking, determination and a clear vision of goals can transform dreams into reality. Hill has studied the lives of great successful men, such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford and Thomas Edison, for over 25 years and has distilled their secrets into this timeless masterpiece.\n\n---\n\n## Book Summary\nThe book is based on 13 fundamental principles that, according to Hill, are essential to achieving success. Among them:\n- **Burn desire**: It all starts with an intense and well-defined desire.\n- **Faith**: Firmly believing in your goals.\n- **Autosuggestion**: Using positive affirmations to influence the subconscious.\n- **Specialized knowledge**: Learning specific skills useful for your goals.\n- **Perseverance**: Never give up, even in the face of difficulties.\n\nHill emphasizes that success is not only material, but also involves personal growth, happiness and inner satisfaction.\n\n---\n\n## The Power of Positive Thinking and Vision\nOne of the central concepts of the book is the power of thought. Napoleon Hill explains that every great result starts with a clear idea and the belief that we can achieve it. Our mind is a very powerful tool, and by focusing on what we want, we attract the opportunities and resources necessary to achieve it.\n\n### The Importance of Clear Goals\nA key point of the book is that success does not come by chance: it is the result of defined goals and a well-structured plan. Hill recommends writing down your goals and rereading them every day, to keep your motivation and focus alive.\n\n---\n\n## Sacrifice and Perseverance: The Recipe for Success\nHill emphasizes that success requires sacrifice, dedication and strong perseverance. There will be obstacles along the way, but what distinguishes those who succeed from those who fail is the ability to stay the course despite the difficulties. This approach is very similar to the concept of “resilience”, which is still essential today.\n\n---\n\n## Why *Think and Grow Rich* is Still Current\nDespite having been written almost a century ago, the message of the book remains extremely relevant. Hill's principles are universal and applicable in every aspect of life: from work to family, from personal relationships to the most ambitious dreams. The book teaches us that there are no limits to what we can achieve, if we are willing to work on ourselves and believe in our potential.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n*Think and Grow Rich* is not just a book, but a real manual for transforming your life. Napoleon Hill shows us that success is a matter of mindset, goals and constant action. An essential read for anyone who wants to improve, grow and realize their dreams.\n",

    "content": "\n## Introduction, The Power to Transform Adversity into Opportunity\n*Il Vento Contro* by Daniele Cassioli is a book about resilience, courage and the ability to see life's challenges as opportunities to grow. Cassioli, a Paralympic athlete who has been blind since birth, is an extraordinary example of how it is possible to overcome the limits imposed by circumstances and live a full and meaningful life. The book is a journey through personal experiences, reflections and lessons that inspire anyone who reads it.\n\n---\n\n## Book Summary\nIn *Il Vento Contro*, Daniele Cassioli talks about his life and his journey as a water skier, but above all as a man who has been able to transform blindness into a strength. Among the pages we find:\n- **Daily challenges**: How to face a world designed for those who can see, without ever losing the desire to improve.\n- **Passion for sport**: Cassioli shows that sport is not just competition, but also a powerful tool for inclusion and personal growth.\n- **Universal Lessons**: Through anecdotes and reflections, Daniele teaches us that every obstacle, even the most difficult, can become a push to move forward.\n\nThe title, *The Wind Against*, perfectly represents the idea that difficulties should not stop us, but can be used to gain momentum.\n\n---\n\n## The Wind Against: A Message of Resilience\nA central theme of the book is the ability to see the headwind not as an enemy, but as an opportunity to grow and become stronger. Cassioli invites us to reflect on how we react to adversity and shows us that the real limit often lies in our mind, not in external circumstances.\n\n### The Example of Daniele Cassioli\nWhat makes *The Wind Against* so powerful is the authenticity of Daniele's story. His life is a concrete example of resilience and determination:\n- **Overcoming one's limits**: Despite being blind, Cassioli has become an award-winning athlete, demonstrating that success is a matter of mindset.\n- **Finding Strength in Difficulty**: Daniele explains how his challenges helped him develop extraordinary skills, such as listening and greater awareness of the world.\n- **Inspiring Others**: Through his story, Daniele conveys a message of hope to anyone who finds themselves facing a \"headwind\" in their life.\n\n---\n\n## My Opinion\nI found *Il Vento Contro* deeply inspiring, especially for Cassioli's ability to transform every adversity into an opportunity for growth. However, I must admit that some reflections seemed familiar to me, having read other personal growth books. Despite this, the strength of the book lies in the authenticity of Daniele's voice and in his ability to make his experiences universal, which I was able to experience during the inauguration of the 2024/2025 academic year in which Daniele participated and gave a speech lasting 1:30h.\n\n---\n\n## Why Read *Il Vento Contro*\nThis book is an essential read for those seeking inspiration to face their challenges. Daniele Cassioli's story reminds us that:\n1. **Resilience is a choice**: We can choose how to react to difficulties.\n2. **Every limit can become a strength**: It all depends on how we face it.\n3. **Life is an opportunity, despite everything**: Even when it seems impossible, we can find a way to move forward.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n*Il Vento Contro* by Daniele Cassioli is a book that speaks to the heart and mind. It is a life testimony that invites us to look beyond appearances and find the strength within ourselves to face any difficulty. A work that I recommend to anyone who wants to discover the true meaning of resilience.\n",

    "title": "Rich and Poor Dad | Robert Kiyosaki",
    "content": "\n# Rich Dad Poor Dad: Personal Finance for Everyone?\n\n## Introduction\n*Rich Dad Poor Dad* by Robert Kiyosaki is one of the most popular books in the world of personal finance. First published in 1997, it chronicles the lessons the author learned from two father figures: “Rich Dad” (the father of a friend who is a successful entrepreneur) and “Poor Dad” (Kiyosaki’s biological father who is educated but stuck in an employee mentality). The book aims to teach money management and investing principles, emphasizing the importance of changing one’s approach to wealth.\n\n---\n\n## Book Summary\nThe central message of *Rich Dad Poor Dad* revolves around a series of contrasts between two approaches to financial life:\n- **Employee Mentality vs. entrepreneurial mindset**: While “Poor Dad” promotes traditional education and a stable job, “Rich Dad” emphasizes the importance of creating passive income streams through investments.\n- **Actives vs. Passives**: According to Kiyosaki, the goal should be to accumulate assets (assets that generate income) and reduce liabilities (expenses that take money away).\n- **Learn to make money work for you**: A key lesson is that money should be seen as a tool to be put to work, rather than simply earning a paycheck.\n\nThe book is written in a simple and accessible way, designed for a broad audience and those new to the world of personal finance.\n\n---\n\n## My Take: Interesting, but Overrated\nDespite its popularity, I have to admit that I found the book to be a bit overrated. For someone like me who grew up in a family with an entrepreneur father, many of the concepts Kiyosaki explains are trivial or already known. Since I was a child, I have heard teachings such as “invest in assets” or “create sources of passive income”. These are things that I have always breathed and that have been transmitted to me as part of the entrepreneurial mentality.\n\n---\n\n## Why It Can Be Useful for Others\nDespite this, I recognize the value of *Rich Dad Poor Dad* for those starting from scratch. The book offers a clear and accessible perspective on money management, breaking some taboos and challenging the idea that financial success depends only on the traditional school path. For those who have never had access to these concepts, the book can represent a turning point and an introduction to the world of finance.\n\n### Strengths\n1. **Simplicity**: Kiyosaki uses concrete examples and direct language.\n2. **Motivation**: The book pushes you to reflect on your approach to money and the possibilities of changing your life.\n3. **Focus on financial education**: An aspect often overlooked in traditional education.\n\n### Limitations\n- **Little depth**: For those who are already familiar with finance or grew up in an entrepreneurial context, the book may seem superficial.\n- **Repetitiveness**: Many concepts are reiterated several times, without adding new details, which is a great thing if it is the first time you come into contact with certain information ( IMPORTANCE OF REPETITION found in Thought -> Repetition is the mother of all skills ), but if you already have a smattering of knowledge it becomes boring.\n- **Examples not always practical**: Some advice is difficult to apply for those who do not have starting resources.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n*Rich Dad Poor Dad* is certainly an interesting book for those who want to approach the topics of personal finance in a simple and immediate way. However, for those who already have a solid foundation or come from an entrepreneurial context, it could be less stimulating and, in some cases, obvious. However, it remains a work that has the merit of having made the dialogue on money management accessible to a very wide audience.",

    "title": "il grifone | Nicola Gratteri",
    "content": "\n## Introduction\n*Il Grifone*, written by Nicola Gratteri, is a work that goes beyond the simple narration of the fight against organized crime. This book represents a true manifesto of dedication to justice, embodied by the author himself. Gratteri, magistrate and symbol of the fight against the 'ndrangheta, dedicates every moment of his life to this mission, sacrificing his personal time and the comforts that his position could guarantee him (a characteristic that fascinates me a lot).\n\n---\n\n## Book Summary\n*Il Grifone* tells stories of corruption, organized crime and the constant challenge to defend the rule of law. Gratteri does not limit himself to describing the mechanisms of the 'ndrangheta: he also illustrates the strategies to fight it, highlighting the importance of a strong, cohesive and determined judiciary.\n\nThe title of the book, symbolic and evocative, refers to a mythological creature that represents vigilance and strength: qualities that well describe Gratteri himself in his daily commitment.\n\n---\n\n## Nicola Gratteri: A Fascinating Comparison with Paolo Borsellino\nReading *Il Grifone* and listening to interviews with Nicola Gratteri, it is impossible not to notice a parallel with figures such as Paolo Borsellino. Like Borsellino, Gratteri has chosen to dedicate every aspect of his life to working for justice, sacrificing his personal life and giving up many privileges to remain faithful to his mission.\n\n### Total Dedication\nNicola Gratteri lives under escort, constantly aware of the risks that his role entails. However, he does not seek recognition or indulgence: his commitment is driven by a deep moral conviction and the desire to leave a better world for future generations. This dedication leads him to give up a private life and those moments of normality that many of us take for granted.\n\n### An Example of Sacrifice and Courage\nLike Paolo Borsellino, Gratteri also demonstrates that justice is a value that requires absolute commitment. Both represent figures who put the collective good first, even at the cost of putting aside their own well-being and personal safety. This aspect makes their example not only admirable, but also deeply inspiring.\n\n---\n\n## Why *Il Grifone* is Important\nThis book is not only a work of denunciation, but also a reflection on how dedication and sacrifice are necessary to face seemingly insurmountable challenges. Gratteri not only describes the reality of organized crime, but invites us to reflect on the collective responsibility in building a more just society.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\nNicola Gratteri, through *Il Grifone*, does not only give us an account of the fight against the 'ndrangheta, but a life lesson. His dedication recalls that of Paolo Borsellino, becoming an example of sacrifice, courage and integrity. This book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the price and value of justice.",

    "content": "## Introduction\nThe *Cognitive Bias Guide* is a book that helps us discover and understand the mechanisms that influence our thinking and decisions. Cognitive biases are systematic errors that we all make in reasoning, often without realizing it. This book offers practical examples and ideas to recognize and address these mental traps, allowing us to improve our decision-making process.\n\n---\n\n## Book Summary\nThe *Cognitive Bias Guide* explores how our mind simplifies reality to save energy, but at the cost of introducing distortions in reasoning. It explains why cognitive biases develop and how they affect different aspects of our lives, from everyday choices to important decisions. Among the biases covered, we find:\n- **Confirmation bias**: The tendency to seek information that confirms our beliefs.\n- **The Dunning-Kruger effect**: The overestimation of one's own skills by those with little experience in a field.\n- **Loss Aversion**: The tendency to fear losses more than we value gains.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding Cognitive Biases: The Key Point of the Book\nThe book shows us how cognitive biases are the result of heuristics, or mental shortcuts that the brain uses to deal with the complexity of the world. These shortcuts, while on the one hand helping us save time, on the other hand can lead us to incorrect conclusions or suboptimal choices.\n\n### Examples of Cognitive Biases\n1. **Confirmation Bias**: Imagine wanting to buy a new smartphone and only reading reviews that speak positively of it, ignoring the negative ones.\n2. **Availability Heuristic**: Estimating the probability of an event based on easily remembered examples, such as thinking that plane crashes are more frequent than they actually are just because we hear about them on the news.\n3. **Framing Effect**: Changing your opinion on a proposal based on how it is presented (for example, preferring a product \"90% fat free\" to one \"with 10% fat\").\n\n### Why is it Important to Recognize Them?\nBeing aware of cognitive biases allows us to:\n- **Avoid recurring errors**: For example, we can reduce the impact of confirmation bias by actively seeking opposing points of view.\n- **Improve decisions**: In both our personal and professional lives, recognizing our biases makes us more objective.\n- **Promote critical thinking**: Becoming more aware of our cognitive limitations pushes us to think more deeply.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\nThe *Guide to Cognitive Biases* is an essential book for anyone who wants to improve their mental awareness and make more informed decisions. It is an inspiring read, full of examples that invites us to examine the way we think and discover how to avoid the most common mental traps.",

    "content": "# Reflections on a Visionary Book\n\nI recently finished reading the book **\"Machina Sapiens\"** by Nello Cristianini, an author I deeply admire for his expertise and ability to make complex topics related to artificial intelligence accessible. This book is not only an exploration of emerging technologies, but also a philosophical journey that fascinated me and, I must admit, a little scared.\n\n## A Summary of the Book\n\n_\"Machina Sapiens\"_ is a brilliant and provocative investigation into the ethical, social and philosophical implications of the development of artificial intelligence. Cristianini guides us through the roots of the discipline, starting from the visions of Alan Turing and arriving at modern machine learning technologies. The book analyzes how machines are progressively \"learning\" to make decisions in ways that we cannot always understand or control.\n\nAmong the central themes we find:\n- The emergence of algorithms capable of influencing society.\n- The challenges of living with non-human intelligences.\n- The ethical questions we must face in this new scenario.\n\nCristianini warns on a fundamental point: **machines do not think, but calculate. Yet, their ability to influence our world grows every day.**\n\nOne of the most powerful sentences in the book, which struck me deeply, is this:\n> **\"The only weapon against the unknown and fear is knowledge.\"**\n\n## The 7 Most Important Lessons Learned\n\n1. **The neutrality of algorithms is a myth**\nAlgorithms are never truly neutral. They reflect the biases and decisions of the humans who designed them, often amplifying them.\n\n2. **The importance of critical understanding**\nWe can no longer afford to ignore how the technologies that influence our lives work. Understanding is the first step to managing their implications.\n\n3. **The risk of losing control**\nOnce systems become too complex, even their creators struggle to understand them. The risk is not that machines will become “conscious,” but that they will act in unpredictable ways.\n\n4. **Alan Turing’s legacy is coming true**\nTuring’s predictions, such as the possibility of creating machines that simulate human thought, are gradually coming true. It is disturbing to see how many of his fears are taking shape.\n\n5. **Technology is not intrinsically good or bad**\nIt is how we use it that determines its impact. We need to develop greater ethical awareness in designing and using AI systems.\n\n6. **The power of information**\nThe ability to collect, analyze and use huge amounts of data is both an opportunity and a threat. Information is power, and controlling it can be dangerous.\n\n7. **Knowledge is our defense**\nTo address the fears and uncertainties related to artificial intelligence, we must educate and prepare ourselves. Only through knowledge can we navigate safely into the future.\n\n## My Reflections\n\nI have to admit that this book left me with a sense of uneasiness. Cristianini's descriptions of the capabilities of machines and their impact on the world made me think about how quickly we are advancing towards a future that seems more and more similar to Alan Turing's predictions. Yet, there is also a note of hope: **we still have the power to shape our future, as long as we choose knowledge and awareness.**\n\n### A Quote to Reflect On\n\nI close with a quote that represents the heart of Cristianini's message:\n> _\"Machines do not think. We do. And it is our responsibility to always do so, even when we entrust them with tasks that seem trivial.\"_\n\nThis book taught me that, if we want to coexist with \"machine sapiens\", we must first learn to know ourselves and the potential of our creations.\n\n---\n\n**I invite you to read \"Machina Sapiens\" to explore these issues in depth and share your reflections! But above all also to NOT be caught unprepared for this revolution that is happening**",

    "content": "## Introduction\n\"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear is an enlightening book that addresses the importance of habits in our daily lives. In a clear and accessible style, the author guides us through the cycle of habits, explaining how they influence our behavior and how we can use them to improve our lives.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of the Book\nThe heart of \"Atomic Habits\" is the explanation of how small, seemingly insignificant habits can accumulate over time to produce big results. The book provides a practical structure for building good habits and breaking bad ones, based on four fundamental laws: **Cue, Craving, Response and Reward**. These elements make up the cycle of habits, a psychological process that determines our behavior.\n\n---\n\n## The Cycle of Habits: The Key Point of the Book\nJames Clear teaches us that every habit follows a cycle composed of four main phases:\n\n1. **Cue**: A stimulus that starts the habit. It can be something we see, hear or feel.\n2. **Desire**: The motivation or impulse to do something. This is where the intention to act is born.\n3. **Response**: The action or behavior itself, which can be good or bad.\n4. **Reward**: The positive (or negative) result that strengthens the likelihood of repeating that habit.\n\n### The Usefulness of Habits\nHabits can be a very powerful tool if we know how to exploit them. For example:\n- **Create positive habits**: Getting used to reading every day even for just a few minutes can transform our cultural and mental life.\n- **Make changes sustainable**: Focusing on small but constant improvements (1% every day, as Clear suggests) can lead us to great progress in the long term.\n\n### When Habits Become Dangerous\nHabits are not always positive. If left unchecked, they can turn into harmful mechanisms, such as giving in to laziness or adopting self-destructive behaviors. The important thing, according to Clear, is to recognize these patterns and change them using the habit cycle as a tool for awareness.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\"Atomic Habits\" is not just a book about habits, but a real guide to personal growth. Learning to recognize and control the habit cycle allows us to build the life we ​​want, one small step at a time. It is a reading that I recommend to anyone who wants to improve themselves, both personally and professionally.",

    "content": "\n### 80 out of 500+. That's the number I still can't believe.\n\n![Hackathon Entrance](hackathon-entry.jpg)\n*Arrival at Caravaggio 37, Milan - October 18, 2025*\n\nWhen I received the confirmation email to participate in the first Italian Vibe Coding hackathon, organized by **Yellow Tech** with the **Lovable** platform, I had to read it twice to believe it was true.\n\nOver **500 people** had applied to participate. Only **80** from all over Europe were selected.\n\nBeing among these 80 people was an honor that I still deeply feel today.\n\n---\n\n## The Context: A Revolution Called Vibe Coding\n\nBefore I tell you what happened that day, let me explain what **vibe coding** is.\n\nVibe coding is a new paradigm in software development: an approach in which applications, websites, and digital tools are created by engaging with artificial intelligence, without ever directly touching the code.\n\nThis isn't traditional no-code or low-code. It's something deeper: you're literally conversing with AI to build your product, just as you would explain your vision to a fellow developer.\n\nLovable is one of the world's leading platforms in this sector. And it has chosen Milan for its official Italian debut, appointing Antonio Pisante (CEO of Yellow Tech) as the brand's first Italian ambassador.\n\n---\n\n## The Location: Caravaggio 37, the Heart of Milan's Innovation\n\n![The spaces of Caravaggio 37](hackathon-space1.jpg)\n![The spaces of Caravaggio 37](hackathon-space2.jpg)\n*The open spaces where the hackathon took place*\n\nThe event was held at **Caravaggio 37**, in Milan's Certosa district. A modern, bright space, perfect for hosting a community of innovators.\n\nAs soon as I entered, I felt the energy: tables full of laptops and, above all, **people**.\n\nStartup founders, university students, AI professionals, hackers, curious developers. All with the same goal: to push themselves beyond their limits.\n\n---\n\n## The Challenge: Cloning Tech Giants in 6 Hours\n![timer](timer.jpg)\n**10:00 AM** - Official opening of the hackathon.\n\n**Sophia Gustafsson**, Community & Growth Lead at Lovable, takes the stage with Antonio Pisante. They explain the challenge:\n\n> \"You have 6 hours. Your goal is to create a working clone of some of the most successful products in tech history: **Airbnb**, **Slack**, **Shopify**.\"\n\nSilence in the room.\n\nThen a nervous laugh. Cloning Airbnb in 6 hours? Without writing code?\n\nBut Sophia continues with a smile:\n\n> \"Clearly, they won't be identical, and they won't have all the features. But you'll have to create something that works, with a credible interface and complete user flows. Something that demonstrates the potential of vibe coding.\"\n\n**Game on.**\n\n---\n\n## My Project: Snooze & Go\n\n### The Result\n\nAfter 6 intense hours of iterations, prompt engineering, and testing, I delivered the project.\n\n👉 **[Try Snooze & Go here](https://preview--snoozeandgo.lovable.app/?from=2025-11-19&to=2025-11-20)**\n\nIt works. It's fast. It's credible.\n\nAnd I built it without writing a single line of code.\n\n---\n\n## Moments of Fun: Networking Between Features\n\n![Ping pong during the break](hackathon-pingpong.jpg)\n*Informal networking during breaks - who says you can't network while playing ping pong?*\n\nOne of the best things about this hackathon was the **atmosphere**.\n\nIt wasn't a toxic competition where everyone jealously guards their own project. It was a **collaborative** environment, almost like a creative jam session.\n\nDuring breaks:\n\n- I played ping pong with an AI startup founder who gave me amazing advice on prompt engineering\n- I discussed growth strategies with college students who had brilliant ideas\n- I exchanged LinkedIn contacts with professionals I now follow with interest\n\nThe networking was spontaneous, genuine, and invaluable.\n\nWhen you put 80 curious minds in a room with powerful tools and shared goals, magic happens.\n\n---\n\n## What I Learned About Vibe Coding\n\n### 1. Prompting Is the New Coding\n\nThe quality of the result depends on the precision with which you describe the problem.\n\nYou can't just say, \"I want a button.\" You have to say:\n\n> \"Create a primary CTA with color #2563EB, rounded border, hover state with transparency, that opens a confirmation modal with email validation and error handling when clicked.\"\n\nAs in traditional coding, precision matters. But now it's expressed in human language.\n\n### 2. Iteration Is Instant\n\n**Traditional Approach:**\nWrite Code → Compile → Test → Debug → Repeat (time: 20-30 minutes per cycle)\n\n**With Vibe Coding:**\nDescribe → View → Refine → Repeat (time: 2-3 minutes per cycle)\n\nI did over **40 iterations** in 6 hours. This would have been impossible with traditional approaches.\n\n### 3. The Focus Shifts From the \"How\" to the \"What\"\n\nI didn't waste any time:\n- Configuring Webpack\n- Managing dependencies\n- Debugging incompatible CSS between browsers\n- Troubleshooting CORS issues\n\nI was able to focus on:\n- **User Experience**\n- **User Flows**\n- **Value Proposition**\n- **Competitive Differentiation**\n\nThe code is generated. **You drive the vision**.\n\n---\n\n## People I Met\n\n### Sophia Gustafsson - Lovable\n\n![Sophia](Sophia.jpg)\n\nSophia was there all day, not only as a judge but as an **active community member**.\n\nWe talked about how vibe coding is changing market dynamics, how the barriers to entry in software development are dramatically lowering, and how this opens up opportunities for millions of people.\n\n### Antonio Pisante - Yellow Tech\n\n![Antonio](Antonio.jpg)\n\nAntonio, CEO of Yellow Tech and the first Italian ambassador for Lovable, led the event with a clear vision:\n\n> \"Vibe coding has the potential to democratize software creation, breaking down technical barriers and opening new opportunities for startups, companies, and individual creators.\"\n\nHis energy and passion for accessible innovation were contagious.\n\n### The Other 79 Attendees\n\nFounders, students, professionals, hackers. Each with their own background, skills, and ambitions.\n\nBut all united by the same curiosity: what happens when AI breaks down technical barriers?\n\nI collected dozens of business cards, added contacts on LinkedIn, and started conversations that I hope will continue well beyond this event.\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts: What It Really Means to \"Democratize\" Software Development\n\nOn the way home that evening, I thought a lot about a word that was repeated dozens of times during the event: **democratization**.\n\nWhat does it really mean to democratize software development?\n\nIt means that:\n\n- A **marketer** can build an internal tool in an afternoon without waiting for the tech team\n- A **student** can validate a business idea without seeking a technical co-founder\n- A **founder** can iterate on the product 10 times before launching, without burning a budget\n- A **non-tech** professional can automate their workflows without depending on others\n\nWe're not just talking about **speed**. We're talking about **who can participate** in creating technology.\n\nAnd that changes everything.\n\n---\n\n## The Future Is Already Here\n\nSaturday, October 18, 2025, wasn't just a hackathon.\n\nIt was a glimpse of the future of work. A future where:\n\n- Ideas matter more than code\n- Creativity trumps syntax\n- Natural language is the primary interface\n\n**The question isn't whether vibe coding will become mainstream.**\n\nThe question is: **Are you ready for a world where anyone can build?**\n\nI chose to be there.\n\nAnd you?\n\n---\n\n## Links and Resources\n\n- 🚀 **[Snooze & Go - My Project](https://preview--snoozeandgo.lovable.app/?from=2025-11-19&to=2025-11-20)**\n- 🔗 **[Lovable](https://lovable.dev)** - The vibe coding platform\n- 🟡 **[Yellow Tech](https://www.yellowtech.it)** - AI training and integration in Italy\n- 📍 **Location:** Caravaggio 37, Milan\n- 📅 **Date:** October 18, 2025",

The experience was organized by **Collegio Di Merito Don Mazza**, an institution that promotes social commitment and volunteering as well as providing accommodation for university students.\n\n## The Cities Visited\n\nDuring our stay, we had the opportunity to explore different areas of Brazil, focusing mainly on Recife and João Pessoa, the largest cities we visited, before heading inland to Zumbi and Itapororoca. These cities are a vibrant mix of culture, history and traditions, but also of social challenges that have deeply affected us since our arrival.\n\n## Significant Moments\n\nIt would be impossible to remember them all since the experience was characterized by moments of joy and just as many of emotional difficulty.\n\n![Serving Food in Itapororoca](food.jpeg)\n\nOne of the most touching memories was when we distributed food to people in need, an act that made us realize the critical reality in which many communities lived.\n\nWe also visited the communities of **Olinda** and **Alto do Mateus**, where we saw up close the precarious living conditions of the local people.\n\n![alto do mateus ( João Pessoa )](1.png)\n\n![Brazil differences ( poor & rich side )](2.png)\n\n## Itapororoca Vibes\n\n![Visiting the project at Itapororoca ( first day )](escola.JPG)\nIn Itapororoca, we were hosted by an extraordinary family who dedicated their lives to creating a school and providing aid to the local community. \n\n![Preparation for the Carneval at Itapororoca ( second day )](itapororoca.jpeg)\n\nWe had the opportunity to meet each member of their family, wonderful people who welcomed us with unprecedented openness and hospitality, which deeply touched me. \n\n\n![itapororoca host large Family](itapororoca.JPG)\n\nThe moment of saying goodbye was extremely difficult, as the bond that had been created was sincere and deep. \n\n![itapororoca host family party](itapororocaFamily.jpeg)\n\nFortunately, thanks to technology, we are still able to stay in touch, sharing moments and memories that unite us despite the distance.\n\n![itapororoca nature walk](triglia.JPG)\n\n## Beira da Linha Project\n\n![Beira da Linha Project with child](beiraTogether.jpeg)\n\nWithout a doubt, my favorite project was **Beira da Linha**. Here we assisted teachers in their lessons and I had the opportunity to interact with children and young people who attended after-school activities. \n\n![Beira da Linha Project timeout](beihra.jpeg)\n\nThese young people, coming from difficult backgrounds, aspired to a better future, and my bond with them was extraordinary. The possibility of contributing to their educational journey was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.\n\n![Beira da Linha Project with organizers](organizers.jpeg)\n\nAnd my greatest respect goes to these educators who dedicate their lives to improving that of the new generations\n\n![Beira da Linha Project bare foot football](Football.JPG)\n\nDuring our stay there, as a tradition in Brazil, we played football a lot...but the difference was that we were all playing barefoot on the concrete since they only had one pair of shoes, or sometimes not even those and therefore they couldn't/didn't want to ruin them\n\n![Last photo with my favourite Beira da Linha Project kids](boys.jpeg)\n\n## A Unique Group\n\n![Group at Beira da Linha Project ](all.jpeg)\n\nThe group with which I shared this adventure was also fantastic. \n\n![itapororoca host familiy home](house.jpeg)\n\nWe hit it off right away, creating bonds that made the experience even more unique and I really have to thank you Noemi, Federica, Maristella, Andrea, Rachid for the amazing experience that we've made. \n\n![Beach of jacarè sunset with Alberto](praia.JPG)\n\nBack home, I can finally reflect on what I experienced and assimilate the messages and lessons learned. \n\nThree months have passed since I returned, but the emotions and experiences I lived in Brazil continue to influence my daily life.\n\nWe shared so much in only three weeks and when it comes to my mind it seems like a film...too good to be true\n\n![Exploring the canyon with Alberto](canyon.jpeg)\n\n\n## Contribution to Projects / Mazzian Ideals\n\nI have actively participated in volunteer projects organized by **Collegio Don Mazza**, with particular attention to education and social support initiatives.\n\nDuring this experience, I collaborated on projects aimed at improving the socio-educational conditions of children and adolescents in disadvantaged areas, including after-school activities, creative and sports workshops, and literacy programs. I also had the opportunity to contribute to social inclusion and the promotion of the psychophysical well-being of young people, working in an intercultural exchange context that enriched my relational and organizational skills.\n\n## Soft Skills Development\n\nThis experience has allowed me to develop important soft skills such as teamwork, leadership and problem solving skills. The daily challenges and the need to adapt to a new reality have taught me to collaborate effectively with others and to look for innovative solutions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMy volunteering experience in Brazil has been a journey of personal and professional growth that I would invite anyone to do, as I recommended during the seminars/meetings of presentation and testimony of the experience that I held together with my fellow adventurers in Rome, Padua and Verona.\n\nI would conclude with a phrase that **Nelson Mandela** once said:\n\n> \"Education is the most powerful weapon you can use.\"\n\nThis phrase perfectly encapsulates the essence of my journey and the meaning of the work we have done and the message that I tried to pass on to these young Brazilians. I hope to continue to carry forward the teachings of this experience and to contribute to the improvement of people's lives, wherever I am.\n\n\n# Here are some more photos about our stay\n![itapororoca](visit.jpeg)\n![itapororoca](wow.jpeg)\n![itapororoca](asilo.jpeg)\n![Group](1school.jpeg)\n![itapororoca](school.JPG)\n\n# Here a short recap video about the experience\n\n\n\n[Watch Video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptVTxfSqaCo)\n\n",

    "content": "My 21st birthday was unique, an experience I will never forget. I spent it in Brazil, during my volunteering period, far from home and all my loved ones. On that occasion, I was not surrounded by the familiar faces of friends and relatives, but by six strangers, who shared with me the experience of volunteering in a country so different from mine.\n\n![Relaxing morning in Olinda beach](spiaggia.png)\n\nI did not expect anything special. Usually, birthdays have never had a particular meaning for me, but that day turned out to be different, special, unique. Celebrating a birthday far from home and loved ones was a first step out of my comfort zone. It allowed me to live the moment with lightness and curiosity, immersed in a new experience.\n\n### An Unexpected Surprise\n\n![us waiting for Eltom on the seaside](us.png)\n\nWhat made my birthday truly memorable was the surprise that my travel companions organized. They found out only a few days later that I had turned 18, and they decided to surprise me with a surprise that left me speechless. One morning we woke up at 4:30, ready to go and watch the sunrise on the beautiful Brazilian beach of Cabo Branco.\n\nI had no idea what to expect. We reached the beach, the sky was starting to turn warm, a prelude to dawn. It was then that they gave me a cake, prepared especially for me. We all shared it together, eating and enjoying the sunrise in one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen and then ending it in style with dinner with Don Eltom and Don Alberto who accompanied us on our volunteer experience in the Northeast of Brazil.\n\n![My Birthday Brazilian Dinner](dinner.JPG)\n\n### A Moment of Pure Happiness\n\nIn those moments of simplicity and friendship, I felt truly happy. It was a moment of pure connection, of gratitude towards life and towards these people who, even if they had just met, had made that day special. I realized how precious it was to step out of my patterns and embrace what is new and unexpected that life has to offer.\n\n### Advice from the Heart\n\nIf I can give you advice, it is to accept every experience that happens to you, even those that scare you or that seem difficult or \"not made for you\". Those experiences will change you and make you grow. Getting out of your comfort zone, experiencing the world with openness and curiosity: these are the things that will give you unforgettable moments.\n\nThat birthday away from home, in Brazil, taught me the value of sharing, friendship and adventure. It was an experience that I will always carry in my heart also with the other part of my journey there in Brazil doing volounteering activity\n\n![The last day in the Beihra Da Linha Project](beihra.JPG)\n\n",

    "content": "\n# An Experience That Changes Your Perspective: Wheelchair Basketball\n\nThanks to the extraordinary collaboration between **Collegio Don Mazza**, **Residenza Ferrari delle Spade di Verona** and **Olympic Basket Verona**, I had the opportunity to live one of the most significant experiences of my life: trying **wheelchair basketball**.\n\n![This is Me having fun trying this new unbelivable sport](me.jpeg)\n\n## A unique experience\n\nThis discipline goes far beyond a simple game. It is a real lesson in strength, determination and inclusion. Sitting in a wheelchair, picking up the ball and trying to move, shoot and collaborate with the rest of the team was enlightening.\n\nI learned that sport is a universal language, capable of breaking down all types of barriers – physical, mental and cultural. It was an opportunity to see the world from a completely different perspective, to recognize the daily challenges that many athletes face and to appreciate their commitment and resilience.\n\n## Sport as a driver of inspiration\n\nAs Nelson Mandela said:\n> *“Sport has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people like few other things in the world.”*\n\nThis is exactly what I felt during this experience. Sport is a powerful tool to overcome limits and to build authentic bonds with those around us.\n\nAnother phrase that strongly resonates with this experience is that of John Wooden:\n> *“Don’t let what you can’t do get in the way of what you can do.”*\n\nWheelchair basketball shows that with passion, determination and team spirit there are no insurmountable obstacles.\n\n## Olympic Basket Verona: a reality to discover\n\nA special thanks goes to **Olympic Basket Verona**, a reality that represents a true example of inclusion and promotion of sport for all.

    "title": "CINECA FORTRAN COURSE",
    "content": "\nA few days ago, I had the opportunity to spend a whole week in Bologna, hosted by **CINECA**, to take their course: **Introduction to Fortran for Scientific Computing**.\n\nIt was an incredibly formative and, in some ways, unique experience.\n\n### The only \"computer scientist\"\n\nThe first thing I noticed, and what made the course even more interesting, was my background. Of all the participants (many of them chemists, materials engineers, or scientific researchers), **I was the only one with a purely computer science background**.\n\nThis created a wonderful exchange: on the one hand, Fortran is a language that lives and thrives in high-performance computing (HPC), a world that \"breathes\" science. On the other, my approach was perhaps more oriented towards code optimization, structure, and the programming best practices I've studied since high school.\n\nThis is why I was able to apply many concepts I had already studied and encountered with languages ​​like C or Java without any problems, immediately, to Fortran as well (unlike other languages, for which it wasn't something immediate).\n\nSeeing how these two worlds intersect in modern Fortran was fascinating.\n\n## The Importance of Feeling \"Ignorant\"\n\nThere's something incredibly stimulating about being surrounded by highly competent people and the importance of the environment. I admit that at times I felt very ignorant, but it's precisely this feeling that I love. It's not a limitation, it's a driving force. Every question I didn't know the answer to, every concept I struggled to immediately grasp, every complex technical discussion fueled my desire to learn.\n\nBeing supported by such knowledgeable professionals made me realize how much there still is to discover and how important it is to never rest on one's laurels. This experience has encouraged me even more to accelerate my learning pace, to dedicate more time to studying, and to never settle.\n\nI want to sincerely thank **CINECA** for the opportunity and the impeccable organization. But a special thanks goes to the teachers and tutors who guided us on this journey: **Caterina Caravita, Angela Acocella, Tommaso Gorni, Lorenzo Varassi, and Moreno Guernelli**.\n\nTheir expertise, kindness, and availability were exceptional.\n\nThere's no better feeling than being surrounded by professionals of this caliber. They make you feel pleasantly \"ignorant,\" in the best sense of the word: they show you how much ground there is still to cover and how many fascinating things there are to learn.\n\n**This kind of stimulation is priceless and encourages me even more to pick up the pace** and continue to delve deeper.\n\n## Materials and Resources\n\nFor those who are curious or would like to take a look at the course materials, I've uploaded everything to my GitHub repository. You can find exercises, code examples, and notes I've collected over the past few days.\n\n🔗 [Course repository](https://github.com/simo-hue/fortran-cineca-course)\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis week at CINECA reminded me why I chose this path. My passion for computer science and scientific computing is fueled by experiences like this: quality training, competent people sharing their knowledge, and the constant feeling that there's always something new to learn.\n\nIf you have the opportunity to attend CINECA courses or workshops, I highly recommend it. It's absolutely worth it.\n\n---\n\n*Thanks again to the entire CINECA team for this opportunity!*",
